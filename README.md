## Meet ARFaceDetection by Cleveroad

You know, guys, we have become a bit obsessed with music recently. See yourself by checking our previous work on the Audio Visualization View library. Since we wanted to create a companion to our equalizer and add to the collection of Android widgets, the idea to develop a nice and convenient audio widget was born almost immediately. So if you have already developed a music player and you feel that you want to make it even better, then you’re welcome to use our library and enjoy the results.

Our invention can facilitate the user’s interaction with a music player and nicely decorate his device screen. Moreover, it’s really easy to integrate! Read our <strong><a href="https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/case-study-audio-widget-overlay-view-by-cleveroad">Case Study: Audio Widget Overlay View by Cleveroad</a></strong> to ensure that and find more of useful information.
